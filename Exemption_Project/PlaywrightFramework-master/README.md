# Playwright Framework

*- This project is a base project to build a solid test automation framework using playwright test automation tool and typescript programming language.*

*- You can use this framework to be a start point for your test automation project to write your automated test cases.*

*- You can find more details in playwright official website documentation:*
https://playwright.dev/docs/intro

## `How to run?`

### A. Running normal test cases:

#### 1- Use direct command as below:

        npx playwright test

#### 2- Show the report:

        npx playwright show-report

#### 3- To pass the used environment or language you can use the below bash command:

        ENV=test LANGUAGE=ar npx playwright test

### B. Running test cases using a pre-defined script in package.json:

        npm run {predefined command}

### C. Running cucumber test:

        cucumber-js test

### D. Generating/ Opening Allure report:

#### 1- Generate the report:

        npx allure generate {report path} -o {generation path} --clean

#### 2- Open the report:

        npx allure open {generated report path}

### E. Using Eslint to make static analysis:

#### 1- Run Eslint command:

        npx eslint {file path} 

#### 2- Check the errors across the files

## `Project Structure:`
*The below is a package diagram for the implemented project structure "Files and folders"*

![Screenshot](PlaywrightFramework.jpg)

## `General instructions and guidelines:`

* Specify files and tags that should be run according to business group and testing needs

* Configure package.json file for frequently used commands

* Configure .env file for test environment, secrets and used language

* Every test should have its representative name

* Pages should hold locators, strings, actions and assertions

* Assertions uses playwright validations and assertion module

* It is recommended to collect cases under describe group

* Files and folders should be named with this formate {firstWord-SecondWord..}

* Variables and methods should start with small letters

* Write locators, scenario steps and tests in the order of the page under test

* Do not assert on existence of a certain element if we will assert on its text

* Do not write any functions if you will not use it

* For every api we create tests in spec file and general used bodies, headers and params under endpoints directory

* For using BDD approach, every feature should has 3 files (feature file - steps - page)

* For using BDD approach, feature files should have business scenarios

* For using BDD approach, steps should has technical steps and use pages

* For using BDD approach, steps module should be named with {featureName-steps}

* For using BDD approach, do not make more than 2 Then in the scenario except view page scenario

#### *`Notes:`*
* *It is not recommended to use BDD framework in playwright project as you will lose some of playwright advantages*
* *If you will not use BDD framework, you will need to remove these folders and files: (cucumber.json - features - steps)*
